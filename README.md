# Example of a Lambda Function 

Kinda a boilerplate, this repository contains an example of a easy lambda function. If you want to use on AWS, you must configure the ARN, buckets, etc.
It's a nice kickstart, and works fine to comprehend the lambda workflow.
This repo includes a vscode/launch.json file for debugging/run the lambdas on local.


## What do you need:

* SAM CLI - [Install the SAM CLI](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/serverless-application-model/latest/developerguide/serverless-sam-cli-install.html)
* Node.js - [Install Node.js 14.x](https://nodejs.org/en/), including the NPM package management tool. I strongly recommend the v14.19.x version.
* Docker - [Install Docker community edition](https://hub.docker.com/search/?type=edition&offering=community)
* AWS Toolkit extention for VSCode - Not obligatory but highly recommended.

## Deploy the sample application

The Serverless Application Model Command Line Interface (SAM CLI) is an extension of the AWS CLI that adds functionality for building and testing Lambda applications. It uses Docker to run your functions in an Amazon Linux environment that matches Lambda. It can also emulate your application's build environment and API.

## First time with lambdas?

Read the AWS documentation to know how to configure the project and so.
